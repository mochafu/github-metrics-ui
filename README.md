# dev-metrics-dashboard

Read-only engineering-metrics dashboard over the `github-metrics` collector's
Supabase Postgres. Express serves a JSON API + a no-build vanilla-JS SPA
(`public/index.html` + `app.js` + `styles.css`, Chart.js vendored locally).

```bash
npm install
node src/server.mjs        # http://localhost:4000  (DASHBOARD_PORT to override)
```

`.env` needs only `DATABASE_URL` (the Supabase **pooler** string — same one the
collector writes to; if they differ, the dashboard shows stale data).

## Philosophy

- **Team-level insight, not individual scoring.** There is deliberately no
  commit-count leaderboard. Contributor views are directories ordered by
  recency; volume columns exist for context and sorting, not ranking.
- **Honest proxies.** Most repos don't emit real GitHub Deployments, so
  deploy-based DORA metrics fall down a labeled ladder:
  Deployments → Releases → merges to main → green CI on main. Every number
  says which signal produced it.
- **Honest freshness.** Backfill may be in flight; the UI shows "data as of"
  everywhere and banners when data is stale, instead of pretending to be live.

## API

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | `{ok}` + DB ping |
| `GET /api/overview[?range=1d\|1w\|6w\|12m\|all]` | all-time totals, per-repo stat rows (incl. CFR/MTTR/issues/lastActivity), `rangeExtras` (range-scoped distinct contributors + lead-time p50), freshness |
| `GET /api/trends?range=1d\|1w\|6w\|12m\|all[&repo=id]` | zero-filled buckets of every metric (1d→hourly, 1w→daily, 6w→weekly, 12m/all→monthly) |
| `GET /api/team` | contributor directory (recency-ordered), org work mix, active-30d |
| `GET /api/status` | row counts per table + latest event timestamp |
| `GET /api/activity[?repo=id]` | commit punchcard: 7×24 day-of-week × hour-of-day grid (UTC) + peak / after-hours / weekend shares |
| `GET /api/workflows[?repo=id]` | per-workflow CI reliability (runs, pass rate, retry rate, median duration, last run) + summary |
| `GET /api/reviews[?repo=id]` | review outcomes (approved / changes-requested / commented), coverage of merged PRs, reviews-per-PR |
| `GET /api/issues[?repo=id]` | resolution mix (completed vs not-planned), open-backlog age buckets, comment engagement, close p50 |
| `GET /api/repo/:id` | summary (incl. bus factor), deploy series, review health, recent PRs |
| `GET /api/repo/:id/weekly` | 12-week commit digest with LLM summaries |
| `GET /api/repo/:id/commits` | commit scatter-timeline rows |
| `GET /api/repo/:id/contributors` | per-contributor stats for one repo |
| `GET /api/contributor/:login` | cross-repo profile |
| `GET /api/contributor/:login/commits` | commits for the profile activity chart |

DORA coverage: deployment frequency (`deployPerWeek` + method), lead time
(PR open→merge p50/p90 — a proxy; true DORA is commit→deploy), change failure
rate (failed CI on the default branch), time-to-restore (median red-streak →
next green on the default branch).

## How each metric is calculated

All figures come from the collector's raw tables (`commits`, `pull_requests`,
`pr_reviews`, `workflow_runs`, `issues`, `deployments`, `releases`). Bots are
excluded via `author_is_bot`. "Default branch" means `main`/`master`.

| Metric | Exact calculation | Proxy / caveat |
|---|---|---|
| **Commits** | `count(*)` of non-bot commits (by `authored_at`). | — |
| **Active contributors** | `count(distinct author_login)` of non-bot commits in the window. | Overview KPI is scoped to the selected range; can't be summed from buckets (would double-count). |
| **PRs opened / merged** | `count(*)` by `created_at` / count where `merged_at is not null`. | — |
| **Merge rate** | KPIs & trend: `merged ÷ opened` in the window. Repo/contributor cards: `merged ÷ (merged + closed-unmerged)`. | Two definitions exist; each is labeled where shown. |
| **Lead time p50/p90** | `percentile_cont` of `(merged_at − created_at)` in hours, over PRs merged in the window. | Proxy for DORA lead time (true DORA is first-commit→deploy). |
| **CI pass rate** | `success ÷ (success + failure + other-completed)` workflow runs; org KPI is run-count-weighted across repos. | Counts all workflows, not only deploy pipelines. |
| **Deploy frequency** | Events per week from the first non-empty rung of the ladder: GitHub Deployments → published Releases → merges to default branch → successful CI on default branch. Reported method says which rung. | Most repos have no real Deployments API signal, so this is usually a merge/CI proxy. |
| **Change failure rate (CFR)** | `failure ÷ (success + failure)` workflow runs on the default branch. | Proxy — real CFR needs deployment outcomes, which we don't have. |
| **Time to restore (MTTR)** | Median hours from the **start** of a red streak on the default branch to the next green run (`lag()` collapses consecutive failures to one streak). | Proxy — CI recovery, not production incident recovery. |
| **Issues opened / closed** | `count(*)` by `created_at` / `closed_at` in the window. Issue close p50 = `percentile_cont` of `closed_at − created_at`. | — |
| **PR reviews** | `count(*)` of review submissions (`pr_reviews.submitted_at`). Review coverage = merged PRs with ≥1 review ÷ merged PRs. Time-to-first-review p50 = median `first review − PR created`. | — |
| **Work mix / focus** | Grouped by `commit_analysis.change_type` (LLM-classified: feature / bug_fix / refactor / test / docs / config / chore). | Depends on LLM classification coverage. |
| **Working-patterns punchcard** | `count(*)` of non-bot commits grouped by `extract(dow …)` × `extract(hour …)` of `authored_at`. After-hours = outside 09:00–18:00; weekend = Sat/Sun. | **Timestamps are UTC**, not contributors' local time — read peaks as UTC. |
| **CI / workflow reliability** | Per `workflow_runs.name`: pass rate = `success ÷ (success+failure)`; retry rate = `run_attempt>1 ÷ runs`; duration p50 = median `updated_at − run_started_at`. | Wall-clock incl. queue time; duration only where both timestamps exist. |
| **Review health** | Outcome mix from `pr_reviews.state` (approved / changes-requested / commented); coverage = merged PRs with ≥1 human review; reviews-per-PR = reviews ÷ merged PRs. | Only recorded reviews — many PRs merge without a review event, so volumes can be low. |
| **Issue insights** | Resolution via `state_reason` (completed vs not-planned); backlog age buckets from open-issue `created_at` (<1w / 1–4w / >1mo); comment engagement = median `comments`. | `state_reason` may be null on older issues (shown as untyped). |
| **Bus factor / concentration** | Per repo: fewest contributors whose commits sum to ≥50% of the repo's commits; top-contributor share = largest author's fraction. | A **risk** signal (knowledge concentration), not a productivity ranking. |
| **▲▼ delta** | Last **complete** bucket vs the one before it (current still-running bucket excluded). Basis = the range's bucket size (hour/day/week/month). | Not YoY — it is period-over-period at the selected granularity. |

Two signals were deliberately **left out** because the collector only populates
them for a small fraction of rows (they'd mislead): per-commit code churn
(`additions`/`deletions`, ~5% coverage) and PR size (`changed_files`, ~11%).

## Security posture

- Strict CSP (`script-src 'self'`, no CDNs, no inline JS), `nosniff`,
  `frame-ancestors 'none'`, no-referrer. All DB-sourced strings are
  HTML-escaped client-side; no inline event handlers.
- Route params validated before Postgres (bigint ids, GitHub login shape);
  all SQL is parameterized; API errors are generic (no driver leakage).
- Per-IP rate limit (240 req/min) and `Cache-Control: no-store` on `/api`.
- CSV export defuses spreadsheet formula injection (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`).
- **Recommended (manual, in Supabase):** create a read-only role for this app
  instead of using the owner connection, e.g.
  ```sql
  create role dashboard_ro login password '<generated>';
  grant usage on schema public to dashboard_ro;
  grant select on all tables in schema public to dashboard_ro;
  alter default privileges in schema public grant select on tables to dashboard_ro;
  ```
  then point this app's `DATABASE_URL` at it. The same role is the safe one to
  hand to any future SQL-generating LLM agent.

## Verifying changes

`preview`-style tooling can't run this server in some sandboxes; verify with:
```bash
node src/server.mjs &        # then
curl -s localhost:4000/api/overview | head -c 400
```
plus the jsdom render harness (drives the real SPA against the live API and
asserts on rendered views) if you keep one around from development.
